# Algebraic Operator OLEAJE

This repository documents the original formulation of the `OLEAJE` operator, created by Jacobo Cánovas García. The operator models modulated interference between two pulsating systems (water and air), generating a vibrant membrane that can be visualized and used to trigger semantic events.

## Formula

OLEAJE(A, V, t) = A(t) · V(t) · sin(2πt / To + φo)

## Applications

- Physical wave simulation
- Narrative or editorial event activation
- Dynamic system visualization
- Modular semantic architecture
